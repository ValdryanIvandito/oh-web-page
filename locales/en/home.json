We are an alliance and a family of people who have a\n                vision to establish God's Kingdom on Earth as we unite into one\n                body of Christ.","t3":"'Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor\n              gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you\n              not of more value than they? â€œTherefore I say to you, do not worry\n              about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor\n              about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food\n              and the body more than clothing?'","t4":"Matthew 6:25-26","t5":"OUR","t6":"SERVICES","t7":"Your browser does not support the video tag.","t8":"EVERY","t9":"WEDNESDAY","welcome":"WELCOME HOME TO"}
